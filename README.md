# Autonomous-Agents-Networks

Autonomous Agents Networks is a preliminary Akraino blueprint. More and more adaptive and autonomous machines, such as robots, drones, self-driving vehicles, etc. are being deployed in different contexts and in close proximity to human activities. With this, there is a need for not only architectural reference but also standards on how machines (or “agents”) will interact with each other and with humans in a safe, reliable, stable and coordinated way. Agents will utilize communications technologies and network standards such as P2P (peer-to-peer), cellular, and satellite to notify each other and humans of important safety related events they detect and observe during their operation.

Business use cases

Flood Prediction, Detection, and Rescue where cameras, water level sensors, drones, meteorological stations and dam leak systems exchange data, send alerts, monitor overall systems and feed different datasets concerning rain level, floods (local and regional flow) etc. Agents include audio and video communication to allow human interaction in real-time to support rescue operations.

Self-driving vehicles Networks can be established and having different types of vehicles connected, exchanging data, adjusting routes, preventing collisions, all in a federated manner.

Manufacturing plants with connected agents adjusting real-time production and roll-outs of parcels.
