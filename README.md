# Autonomous-Agents-Networks

Autonomous Agents Networks is a preliminary Akraino blueprint. A coming onslaught of adaptive and autonomous machines, including mobile robots, drones, self-driving vehicles, etc. are being deployed in different contexts and in close proximity to human activities. With this, there is a need for not only architectural reference but also standards on how machines (or “physical agents”) will interact with each other and with humans in a safe, reliable, stable and coordinated way. Physical agents will utilize communications technologies and network standards such as P2P (peer-to-peer), cellular, and satellite to notify each other and humans of important safety related events they detect and observe during their operation.

## Use Cases

### Flood Prediction, Detection, and Rescue

Cameras, water level sensors, drones, meteorological stations and dam leak systems exchange data, send alerts, monitor overall systems and feed different datasets concerning rain level, floods (local and regional flow) etc. Agents include audio and video communication to allow human interaction in real-time to support rescue operations.

### First Responder Machine Assistants

Mobile robots, drones, and vehicles detect, identify, and report incidents to 1) other machines within a 1 to 5 mile radius, and 2) First Responders depending on incident priority level. Machines from different providers and vendors must observe and understand their surroundings, interact with humans if necessary, and share information about safety - human safety as well as property and other machines. P2P call and satcom network protocols are used to eliminate dependencies on cloud communications subject to vendor incompatibility / lack of cooperation and unreliable connectivity depending on environmental conditions
